- 👋 Hi, I’m @LilPoison
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning the ins and outs of everything. I dont like not understanding what can attack and take over my online accounts,which connects all of the things in my life. Momma Bear has to be ready for her cubs💪👊
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Anything and Everything. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... on what is attacking me or figuring out if it's just some random hacker a person who got a hold of my old phone or someone close who seems to also have an account on here I hope I'm wrong but I have proof.
- 📫 How to reach me ... loudmouthedbrowneyedbeauty@gmail.com or mommaluves@gmail.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: ...she
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm smarter than a lot give me credit for. due to medical issues and other things I didn't get to finish school but when I was I was really good at it principal's list honor roll perfect attendance charity etc always had a fascination with technology. I would impress some with how far I've gotten with what I've learned or the information I've been able to gather
- 😅 Need help.... I'm trying not to destroy my phone in the process of trying to figure all this out I'm going off of Google at this point. but my type of brain needs to understand or it literally will drive me nuts so if anybody can help me through the basics so that I can go on this journey I'd be so grateful and would only use it for good
